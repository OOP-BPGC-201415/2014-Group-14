This project is a Mess Management System written in Java keeping
in mind the principles we have learned from our course "Object
Oriented Programming" (CS F213).

All UML diagrams are in uml/.
All code is in src/ (tests are in src/tests).

The entire folder can be imported into Eclipse as a project.

Please ensure that commits include modified hidden files
(.classpath, etc) to maintain compatibility with Eclipse.

TODO: Setup with Eclipse git plugin instead of manually pushing
hidden manifest/config files.
